Lower Pisang,high,"A large (~200 m wide x 190 m) landslide that occurred between Apr 27 and May 2 has partially dammed the Marsyangdi River, resulting in a lake to become impounded upstream. Approximately 400 m upstream of the landslide is a second, smaller landslide (~85 x 55 m) that occurred earlier (present on Apr 27 image) and constricted the river, resulting in another lake. These two lakes  now form a single lake, more than 500 m long and ~50 m wide. A channel is draining the lake at its southernmost end but cannot evacuate water as quickly as it is being added.",84.135,28.625
Humde,low,"Small (85-m long) south-facing section of bank collapsed/slumped into river. Does not appear to have blocked the channel, only constricted it, causing rapids to form. This is immediately upstream of Humde airport, which is on the south bank.",84.08,28.645

Humde,low,"Small (60-m long) west-facing section of bank collapsed/slumped into river. Appears to have initially dammed river, or at least reduced discharge substantially. Water has ponded upstream, but an outlet has been incised since. Pre-slide river width here 11-15m. Post-slide width ~3m at narrowest.",84.095,28.641
Humde,low,"Small (80-m long) north-facing section of bank collapsed/slumped into river. Appears to not have dammed river, but reduced discharge. Water has ponded upstream.",84.101,28.638
Lower Pisang,low,"Small debris slide (likely) slope failure towards west into river, measuring approx. 83m long (from top of failure) to toe, and 55m wide (at widest). Since image was acquired, river has cut ~3m-wide channel through, rendering hazard low. Small rapids visible in WV2 image downstream of breached dam, likely due to lower discharge and increased sediment load.",84.101,28.628
Brantang (Bhratang),low,"Channelized flow (either debris flow or snow avalanche, or even both sequentially) that appears to have come down in several pulses, blocking the river on at least one occasion.
